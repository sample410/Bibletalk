The same team that created PeepSo and its plugins also created a theme: Gecko. With relying on third party themes everything was out of our hands. No control over the actual display, not entirely anyway. A proof of concept was created and we received amazing feedback from the community. With Gecko we have close to limitless possibilities to showcase PeepSo and its plugins in the most stunning way.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is PeepSo GDPR Compliant? =

PeepSo does have the options and configuration settings that will help you as a responsible site administrator with efforts to meet the obligations and rights enacted under the GDPR. Please note that the configuration options for the GDPR that are built-in PeepSo are covering only our plugins. Should you be using any other 3rd party software that also needs to be GDPR compliant needs to be covered by its respective developers. PeepSo does NOT cover 3rd party solutions under its GDPR compliance features. As a responsible site administrator you yourself must ensure that any and all parts of your website are GDPR compliant when the law applies. 

= Can I use my existing theme? =

We've tested PeepSo with dozens of major themes. But since there are thousands of themes for WordPress, it'd hard for us to test with all of them. Well, virtually impossible. The theme we recommend is [PeepSo Theme: Gecko](https://www.peepso.com/downloads/peepso-theme-gecko/) - it's a theme developed by the same team that makes PeepSo plugins and it can take your community to the next level. Beyond anything 3rd party themes can offer with PeepSo.

Having that said, you can check PeepSo (it's free) with that theme and if you find any problems, please report them and we'll fix whatever PeepSo might be breaking. However, if the case is that the theme itself is interfering with PeepSo's styles and overriding them in any way, there's nothing we'd be able to do. You'd have to contact the theme developers to get that fixed.

= Where do I find translations? =
